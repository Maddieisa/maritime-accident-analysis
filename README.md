This repository contains a Sankey diagram for HFACS-based maritime accident analysis and related data.
Causal Analysis of Maritime Accidents
This dataset presents the results of a causal analysis on maritime accidents, integrating the HFACS framework and key attribute combinations to identify accident types. It includes Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates and Stouffer's combined p-values, providing a statistically grounded assessment of causal relationships.

Additionally, the repository contains three interactive Sankey diagrams (HTML format), categorized by maritime accident types, allowing users to dynamically explore causal pathways.

Contents:
Causal Analysis Data: HFACS + Attribute Combination = Accident Type, with ATE and p-values
Interactive Sankey Diagrams: Visualizing causal interactions across different accident types
Purpose:
This dataset aims to serve as a valuable research resource for maritime accident analysts, safety researchers, and policymakers, offering insights into human factors and accident causality.
